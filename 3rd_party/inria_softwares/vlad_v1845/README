What is it?
===========

This is a Matlab package that we provide to reproduce the results 
of our CVPR paper (paper homepage: http://lear.inrialpes.fr/pubs/2010/JDSP10)

Prerequisites
=============

The prerequisites are a working version of Matlab/mex. We have tested
the software with relatively recent versions (R2009b, R2010a). We have
made the package run with the open-source software Octave (3.2.3). The
installation procedure differs a bit, but skilled Octave users should
be able to make the mex-files of Yael work with octave.



Installation
=============

These instructions are for Linux and MacOS X (just take care for
64-bits Matlab to use "long" instead of "int" for sgemm calls). This
package is not supported for Windows. Sorry.

The commands below should be lanched from the directory where you
unzipped this package.

1) Download the Yael library and the pqcodes package. 

The current package library has been tested with version SVN_v62 of the 
Yael library, but forward compatibility should be preserved. 
The Yael library can be obtained from the website: 
https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/?group_id=2151

The pqcodes package is available from the software webpage of Herve Jegou, 
and can be retrieved as follows:
> wget http://www.irisa.fr/texmex/people/jegou/src/pqsearch_1830.tar.gz


2) Untar the lib and compile its Matlab interface (in subdirectory yael). 
> tar xvzf yael_v62.tar.gz
> rm yael_v62.tar.gz
> cd yael
> ./configure.sh
> cd matlab
> make
> cd ../..

If this does not work on your platform, please take a look at the README 
file and the Yael getting started manual. 


3) Compile additional Mex-file: 
> tar xvzf pqsearch_1830.tar.gz
> rm pqsearch_1830.tar.gz
> mex siftgeo_read_fast.c
> cd pqcodes
> mex sumidxtab.c
> cd ..


4) Get the SIFT descriptors associated with the Holidays database
> wget http://pascal.inrialpes.fr/data/holidays/siftgeo.tar.gz
> tar xvzf siftgeo.tar.gz
> rm siftgeo.tar.gz

5) Launch the test program in matlab:
>> test
